# IMPORTANT: Builds are handled by GitHub Actions (not Netlify)
# This is because PDF/EPUB generation requires LaTeX, which is easier
# to set up on GitHub's macOS runners than on Netlify's Linux builders.

# GitHub Actions builds the site and deploys via Netlify CLI.
# See .github/workflows/static.yml for the build process.
