# Netlify configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Builds are handled by GitHub Actions (not Netlify)
# This is because PDF/EPUB generation requires LaTeX, which is easier
# to set up on GitHub's macOS runners than on Netlify's Linux builders.
#
# GitHub Actions builds the site and deploys via Netlify CLI.
# See .github/workflows/static.yml for the build process.
#
# REDIRECTS: Handled by book/_redirects file (copied to build/html/ by Makefile)
# The _redirects file is used because netlify.toml redirects aren't processed
# when deploying via Netlify CLI.

[build]
  publish = "build/html"
  # This command only runs if someone triggers a build from Netlify UI
  # Normal deploys come from GitHub Actions
  command = "echo 'Site is deployed via GitHub Actions, not Netlify build'"
