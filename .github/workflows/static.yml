# =============================================================================
# GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT (DISABLED)
# =============================================================================
# This workflow is disabled in favor of Netlify deployment.
# Netlify provides native 301 redirects which are better for SEO.
#
# To re-enable GitHub Pages deployment:
# 1. Uncomment this entire workflow
# 2. Go to repo Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions
# 3. Delete or rename netlify.toml to disable Netlify
# 4. Push to main to trigger deployment
#
# See book/HOSTING.md for more details on hosting options.
